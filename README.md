# Zoo-Animal-Database 

Developed a SQL database with historical data and complex constraints, executing advanced queries to analyze data and meet stakeholder needs.

The project focused on a zoo database system, encompassing various tables such as zoos, animals, species, and employees. It required the development and execution of SQL queries to extract meaningful insights, answer specific business questions, and demonstrate database management expertise. The primary objectives included:

Species Diversity Analysis:
One of the key tasks was to calculate the number of distinct species represented in each zoo. This involved using aggregate functions and grouping techniques to determine species diversity, providing insights into the biodiversity of captive animal populations.

Employee Expertise Evaluation:
Another critical task was to identify employees recognized as the world's best experts in specific animal species. This required joining multiple tables, analyzing employee roles, and retrieving associated data, such as their salaries and the zoos they work for. The results were sequenced to ensure clarity and relevance to the intended stakeholders.

Relational Data Insights:
The project also explored complex relationships within the database. By leveraging SQL features such as nested queries, filtering, and joins, it uncovered insights about employee expertise, zoo operations, and species management. This highlighted the interconnected nature of the data and the ability to derive actionable conclusions.

Data Integrity and Optimization:
All queries were designed to be efficient, accurate, and aligned with the business requirements outlined in the project. Special attention was given to ensuring data integrity by adhering to normalization principles and employing constraints where necessary.

Purpose and Learning Outcomes:
This project was a culmination of the ITM 500 course, aiming to bridge academic learning with practical application. It was designed to help students:

Develop hands-on experience in solving real-world problems using SQL.
Understand the complexities of relational databases and their role in business operations.
Strengthen skills in data analysis, query optimization, and report generation.
Demonstrate the ability to turn raw data into actionable insights that can support decision-making.
Undertaking this project provided a comprehensive understanding of how data is structured, stored, and utilized in a professional setting. The zoo database served as a rich case study for simulating scenarios that are common in many industries, such as retail, healthcare, and finance.

Reflection and Relevance:
This project was particularly meaningful because it showcased the practical utility of SQL in addressing real-world challenges. It strengthened critical thinking and problem-solving skills, enabling me to design solutions that meet specific business needs. Additionally, it emphasized the importance of understanding data relationships and optimizing queries for performance.

Completing this project has equipped me with the skills necessary to handle complex databases and contribute effectively to roles that require data analysis, business intelligence, or operational efficiency. It was a rewarding learning experience that laid the foundation for future endeavors in data-driven problem-solving.
